# Media Landscape

This is a project I worked on during the introductory part of my internship at Instiut Jožef Štefan. It uses data from Event Registry to cluster media outlets according to the content they offer.
Each of the media outlets is described in 1905 features, which were extracted from data on thousands of articles (provided by Event Registry). I subsequently used TSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to embed this in 2-dimensional space.
Here is a sample output obtained from a smaller dataset that I used for testing:
